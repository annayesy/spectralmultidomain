class PDO2d:
    """
    Represents a 2-dimensional Partial Differential Operator (PDO) with coefficients for the PDE terms.
    
    Parameters:
    c11, c22, c12: Coefficients for the second-order partial derivatives.
    c1, c2: Coefficients for the first-order derivatives.
    c: Coefficient for the zeroth-order term.

    The partial differential operator is given by:
    A [u](x) = - c11(x) [D11 u](x) - c22(x) [D22 u](x) 
    - 2 c12(x) [D12 u](x) + c1(x) [D1 u](x) + c2(x) [D2 u(x)] + c(x) [u](x)

    We assume the coefficients are smooth. 
    We also assume that the matrix [c11,c12; c12, c22] is positive definite in the domain to ensure ellipticity.
    These assumptions are from the paper by Hao, Martinsson on 3D HPS.
