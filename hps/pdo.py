	Represents a 2-dimensional Partial Differential Operator (PDO) with coefficients for the PDE terms.

	c1, c2: Coefficients for the first-order derivatives.
	c: Coefficient for the zeroth-order term.

	We also assume that the matrix [c11,c12; c12, c22] is positive definite in the domain to ensure ellipticity.
